# Web-dev-projects
This GitHub repository contains the basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects I've made during my College Career.

The file named "Calculator.html" is a basic Calculator app made by me using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I've attached a sample output of this code, named "Calculator.png".
